### 🔧 Projects

 - Head Gear - Bone Conduction & Accident Prevention Smart Helmet
    - Designed & developed a prototype which enhances rider experience & prevents accidents by providing real-time warnings & alerts during distracted driving, accident detection feature embedded HUD & bone conduction earphone for seamless ADAS experience for bike riders.
    - [click here](https://github.com/stark-2000/Head-Gear)

 - Smart Kitchen Robot for Automatic Stuffing & Making of Famous Indian Bread Variety
    - We have Designed and built world’s first fully automated & compact robot that only requires wheat and water to be filled in containers, stuffed parathas / chapatis are made, stacked and stored in hotboxes with smart IOT control. The machine is low cost and would be similar to a microwave oven in both size and cost.

 - Hardware Implementation of Pick & Place Operation using UR5e
    - Developed and programmed Universal Robot's robotic manipulator for a basic pick and place operation. Wrote our custom IK solver which is deployed on hardware using MoveIT and ROS 2. Working towards implementing actions like drawing on a board.

 - Endobot---Pipeline-Inspection-Robot
    - Endobot 2.0, a tethered pipeline inspection robot which can detect leaks, corrosion and defects on pipelines as small as 4 inch up-to a depth of 300 meters and can withstand 5 bar underwater pressure. The robot can be fully controlled from outside the pipeline using sophisticated controllers which enable 4 wheel drive and advanced transmission. Onboard IMU & Encoders enable accurate localisation & distance calculation of the robot. Realtime motor temp, indoor temp, pipeline leak sounds, current consumption, inclination calculation is all performed and displayed on a mini LCD screen.

 - Mono-Camera Human Pose Estimation and Tracking using openCV
    - Developed an algorithm using openCV and laptop web camera for human pose estimation in 3D which gives cartesian coordinates of human in 3D with depth information. It is capable of tracking humans from frame to frame and assigning unique IDs.

 - Black Box Device for Vessels & Fisherman
    - Designed and implemented a tamper-proof solar powered black box device which is capable of logging & sending all essential information of a remote vessel moving in ocean to a virtual dashboard in the coast guard control room where potential threats & alerts are provided on the dashboard based on vessel activity.

 - Sustainable Energy using Cow’s Methanogenesis
    - Proposed a novel device capable of capturing and storing methane gas emissions from cow burps in an inflatable pouch, and later use it for cooking or running a bio fuel based car. Deploying Smart MANET Protocol ensures 24/7 monitoring of cow’s burping pattern and fuel level in pouch.

 - Smart Muffler to prevent Noise Induced Hearing Loss 
    - Designed an algorithm which would use several microphones to capture background noise and identify those sounds which are above 80 dBA & reduce their intensity in real-time and also identifies speech signals in the noise and actively amplifies the voice to be better heard in a noisy environment.

 - Density Based Traffic Lighting System 
    - Designed and developed a prototype of a smart traffic lighting system which is capable of altering the signal timings in each road especially on a 4 road junction based on density of traffic using sensors embedded on the road.
